	<h2>Customer</h2>
		<p>RIT Coffee Shops</p>
    	<h2>Problem</h2>
        	<p>There is currently an inconsistent method for notifying customers that their order is ready in the coffee shops on the RIT campus. Some establishments call out the customers name or number while others display the order name on a screen. For the deaf/hard-of-hearing community calling out a customer's name or order number is ineffective. For the blind/low-vision displaying the name of the board is ineffective. For the hearing community when the restaurant is busy and loud it is difficult to hear when your order is ready. Currently these situations leads to a poor user experience as customers are not aware that their order is ready. The ordering and receiving of goods process needs to be streamlined to improve efficiency and customer satisfaction for the RIT community.
		</p>
	<h2>Solution</h2>
        	<p>Develop an app that allows users to order from their phone and receive an alert (possibly text message or phone would vibrate) when their order is ready. Conduct a contextual inquiry of coffee shops customers and employees to access the desire for such an app. </p>
