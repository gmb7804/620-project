	<h2>Customer</h2>
		<p>RIT Coffee Shops</p>
    	<h2>Problem</h2>
        	<p>There is currently an inconsistent method for notifying customers that their order is ready in the coffee shops on the RIT campus. Some establishments call out the customers name or number while others display the order name on a screen. For the deaf/hard-of-hearing community calling out a customer's name or order number is ineffective. For the blind/low-vision displaying the name of the board is ineffective. For the hearing community when the restaurant is busy and loud it is difficult to hear when your order is ready. Currently these situations leads to a poor user experience as customers are not aware that their order is ready. The ordering and receiving of goods process needs to be streamlined to improve efficiency and customer satisfaction for the RIT community.
		</p>
	<h2>Solution</h2>
        	<p>Develop an app that allows users to order from their phone and receive an alert (possibly text message or phone would vibrate) when their order is ready. Conduct a contextual inquiry of coffee shops customers and employees to access the desire for such an app. </p>
    	<h2>Stakeholders</h2>
        	<ul>
            		<li>Customers</li>
            		<li>Management/employees</li>
			<li>Design Team</li>
			<li>Developers</li>
			<li>Coffee shop vendors</li>
			<li>Student affairs/student services</li>
        	</ul>
	<h2>Stakeholder Goals</h2 
		<ul>
			<li>Customers: to order and be notified in an accessible way that their order is ready thus increasing the user experience
			<li>Management/employees: get the correct order to the correct customer efficiently, reduce the amount of loss (giving customers the wrong orders is a loss), having satisfied customers</li>
			<li>Design team/developers: provide a usable app that increaing effency and the user experience</li>
			<li>Vendors: properly stocking the coffee shops goods offered</li>
			<li>Student affairs: increaing user satisfaction</li>
		</ul>
	<h2>Stakeholder Concerns</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>Customers: order may fail to go through
			<li>Management/employees: possible change in workflow and processing of orders</li>
			<li>Design team/developers: time and resource constraints</li>
			<li>Vendors: possible change in goods required to stock the store</li>
			<li>Student affairs: resources needed to create the app</li>
		</ul>
	<h2>Stakeholder Ideas</h2>
		<p>Will be determined during the contextual inquiry process</p>
	<h2>Involving Stakeholders</h2>
		<p>Involing stakeholders in the design process will make them feel included will create buy-in for the product</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Progress emails will be sent to stakeholders on a weekly basis</li>
			<li>Checkpoint meetings (milestones) will be held to keep stakeholders informed and gather their insight</li>
			<li>Include them in the usablity testing of prototypes</li>
		</ul>
	<h2>Communicating with Stakeholders</h2>
		<ul>
			<li> When feasible interact with them in their own environment - in this case RIT coffee shops</li>
			<li> During checkpoint meetings share:
				<ul>
					<li> context inquiry/affinity diagrams (milestone2)</li>
					<li> sketches</li>
					<li> personas (milestone 3)</li>
					<li> prototypes (milestones 4 & 5)</li>
					<li> results of usablility tests</li>
				</ul>
			(some stakeholders prefer data while others are visual learners)</li>
			<li>Providing any assistants needed during the times of study like having an interpreter </li>
			<li>Have a dialogue about what technology and designs work best for them</li>
		</ul>
